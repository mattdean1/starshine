a theatre ticket booking system for AS computing

my first coding project!


Given a scenario, I created a system for a small local theatre that would allow customers to book seats.

Customers are first asked to select which show, and on what date they would like to attend.

[See the seat selection screen here.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6649285/10972333/9c75239e-83d0-11e5-991a-a5101e66948c.jpg)

![Customers then enter their details and confirm the reservation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6649285/10972324/93d01c44-83d0-11e5-9234-a255c1862eab.png)

I then inserted these details in to the MySQL database, and updated the seat booking info for that show/date.

![The customer also recieves a confirmation email](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6649285/10972290/779144a4-83d0-11e5-8596-e7dc619fe945.JPG)
