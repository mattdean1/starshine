a theatre seat booking system for AS computing

###My first coding project!
Uploaded for posterity and so progress can be shown


####The Project
Given a scenario, I created a system for a small local theatre that would allow customers to book seats.

Customers are first asked to select which show, and on what date they would like to attend.

They then select their seats:

and enter their details/confirm the reservation:

I then insert these details into the MySQL database, and update the seat booking info for that show/date.

The customer also recieves a confirmation email:

Unfortunately the integration of a payment system was outside the scope of the project - the writeup took precedence over the code.
However my A2 project: [[link]] does include a working paypal integration - progress!
